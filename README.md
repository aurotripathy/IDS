### Introduction

This project builds a neural-network based classifier 
on an intrusion detection dataset.
The intrusion detector is a learnt predictive model (a five-class classifier) 
capable of distinguishing between connections categorized as 
intrusions/attacks and normal connections. 

### Dataset Review

The dataset is the NSL-KDD dataset that you can download from the 
[University of New Brunswick](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)
repository.

The training and the test set are two highlighted below.
